    <p>Enjoy these individual beef Wellingtons with no regrets and no second thoughts! Perfectly cooked filet mignon topped with a rich, savory mushroom pate is wrapped in a crispy pastry crust and served on top of a buttery pastry base for a 1-2 punch that's hard to beat. Serve as-is or with a simple, brown pan sauce.</p>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>10 large brown mushrooms, finely chopped</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons minced shallots</li>
        <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons white wine</li>
        <li>2 ounces pate</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Melt butter over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms and salt; cook and stir until well browned and caramelized, about 5 minutes. They will be wet and soggy at first but will dry out.</li>
        <li>Add shallots and cook until they soften up and turn translucent, about 3 minutes. Add black pepper, cayenne, and white wine. Stir until wine evaporates, about 1 minute. Turn off the heat and transfer to a bowl to cool to room temperature.</li>
        <li>Add pate to cooled mushroom mixture; toss and mash with a spoon until thoroughly combined. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Generously season filets with salt and pepper. Melt butter for Wellingtons in the same pan over high heat. Sear, one at a time, in the hot pan until the sides and edges are nicely browned, about 5 minutes per filet. Transfer to a plate and place in the refrigerator until needed.</li>
        <li>Cut each sheet of pastry into 4 squares. Place one square frozen puff pastry onto a lightly floured surface. Spoon about 3 tablespoons pate mixture into the center and press out to roughly the same size as a filet. Spread 1/2 tablespoon mustard on top of one filet and place mustard-side down on the pate.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Enjoy your beef wellington!</p>
